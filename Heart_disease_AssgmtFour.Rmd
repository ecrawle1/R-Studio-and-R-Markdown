# Read the heart disease dataset
```{r}
Heart_disease <- read.csv("C:/Users/ecrawle1/OneDrive - Kent State University/Desktop/Machine Learning/Heart_disease.csv")
```
#Create a dummy variable called "Target" that will be "Yes" if the "MAX_HeartRate" exceeds170 and "No" if it is 170 or below. Additionally, you will create another dummy variable named "BP_New," which will be "Yes" if the blood pressure is above 120 and "No" if it is 120 or below.
```{r}
Heart_disease_data <- Heart_disease %>%
  mutate(
    Target = ifelse(MAX_HeartRate > 170, "Yes", "No"),
    BP_New = ifelse(Blood_Pressure > 120, "Yes", "No")
  )
```
#Q1) Prediction Based on Initial Information: [30 Points] If a person with chest pain presents without any further information, what prediction should we make regarding heart disease?

# The prediction is "Yes", heart disease. If the only available information is the presence of chest pain, with no further details about the personâ€™s heart rate, blood pressure, or other, we need to make a prediction about the likelihood of heart disease based solely on chest pain. Chest pain is often a significant indicator of potential heart issues. However, not all types of chest pain are associated with heart disease.
```{r}
# Display counts of the Target variable
Target_table <- table(Heart_disease_data$Target)
print(Target_table)
```
# Q2) Analysis of the First 30 Records: [3*20=60 Points] Select the first 30 records in the dataset and focus on the "Target" response variable and the two predictors: blood pressure and chest pain type. Create a pivot table that examines heart disease as a function of these two predictors for these 30 records, incorporating all three variables as rows and columns.

# Select the first 30 records and focus on the relevant variables
```{r}
Heart_disease30 <- Heart_disease_data[1:30, c("Target", "BP_New", "chest_pain_type")]

Object1 <- ftable(Heart_disease30)
print(Object1)
 
Object2 <- ftable(Heart_disease30[, -1])
print(Object2)
```
# a. Compute Bayes Conditional Probabilities: Calculate the exact Bayes conditional probabilities of the "Target (Target=yes)" variable given the four possible combinations of the predictors.
```{r}
# Probability calculations
P1 = Object1[3, 1] / Object2[1, 1]  # Target=yes, BP_New=No & chest_pain_type=0
P2 = Object1[4, 1] / Object2[2, 1]  # Target=No, BP_New=Yes, chest_pain_type=0
P3 = Object1[3, 2] / Object2[1, 2]  # Target=No, BP_New=No, chest_pain_type=1
P4 = Object1[4, 2] / Object2[2, 2]  # Target=Yes, BP_New=Yes, chest_pain_type=1

Probability_Target <- rep(0, 30)
for (i in 1:30) {
  if (Heart_disease30$BP_New[i] == "1") {
    if (Heart_disease30$chest_pain_type[i] == "0") {
      Probability_Target[i] = P1
    } else if (Heart_disease30$chest_pain_type[i] == "1") {
      Probability_Target[i] = P3
    }
  } else {
    if (Heart_disease30$chest_pain_type[i] == "0") {
      Probability_Target[i] = P2
    } else if (Heart_disease30$chest_pain_type[i] == "1") {
      Probability_Target[i] = P4
    }
  }
}
```
# b. Classification of Accidents: Classify the 30 records using these probabilities with a cutoff of 0.5.
```{r}
Heart_disease30$Probability_Target <- Probability_Target
Heart_disease30$Pred_Probability <- ifelse(Heart_disease30$Probability_Target > 0.5, "Yes", "No")

print (Heart_disease30)
```
#c. Manual Calculation of Naive Bayes Probability: Manually compute the naive Bayes conditional probability of an injury given that "BP_New" is "Yes" and "chest_pain_type" is 1.
```{r}
# Calculate P(Target = Yes | BP_New = Yes, chest_pain_type = 1)
P_BPYes_CP1 <- sum(
  Heart_disease30$BP_New == "Yes" &
  Heart_disease30$chest_pain_type == 1 &
  Heart_disease30$Target == "Yes"
) / sum(Heart_disease30$BP_New == "Yes" & Heart_disease30$chest_pain_type == 1)

cat("P(Target = Yes | BP_New = Yes, chest_pain_type = 1):", P_BPYes_CP1, "\n")
```
# Q3) Full Dataset Analysis: [50 Points] Now, use the complete dataset. Partition the data into training (60%) and validation (40%) sets. Run the Naive Bayes classifier on the entire training set using the relevant predictors, with "Target" as the response variable. Note that all predictors are categorical. Present the confusion matrix
```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Check structure of the dataset and column names
str(Heart_disease)
colnames(Heart_disease)

# Handle missing values, if any (optional)
Heart_disease <- na.omit(Heart_disease)

# Ensure 'MAX_HeartRate' and 'Blood_Pressure' exist and are correctly referenced
if (!("MAX_HeartRate" %in% colnames(Heart_disease)) || 
    !("Blood_Pressure" %in% colnames(Heart_disease))) {
  stop("Columns 'MAX_HeartRate' or 'Blood_Pressure' are missing.")
}

# Create the dummy variables Target and BP_New
Heart_disease_data <- Heart_disease %>%
  mutate(
    Target = ifelse(MAX_HeartRate > 170, "Yes", "No"),
    BP_New = ifelse(Blood_Pressure > 120, "Yes", "No")
  )

# Check if the new columns were successfully created
head(Heart_disease_data)

# Convert 'Target' and other predictors to factors
Heart_disease_data$Target <- as.factor(Heart_disease_data$Target)
Heart_disease_data$BP_New <- as.factor(Heart_disease_data$BP_New)
Heart_disease_data$chest_pain_type <- as.factor(Heart_disease_data$chest_pain_type)

# Partition data into training (60%) and validation (40%) sets
set.seed(1)
train.index <- sample(row.names(Heart_disease_data), 0.6 * nrow(Heart_disease_data))
valid.index <- setdiff(row.names(Heart_disease_data), train.index)

train.df <- Heart_disease_data[train.index, ]
valid.df <- Heart_disease_data[valid.index, ]

# Train the Naive Bayes model
nb_model <- naiveBayes(Target ~ chest_pain_type + BP_New, data = train.df)

# Predict on the validation set
valid_pred <- predict(nb_model, newdata = valid.df)

# Generate and display the confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(valid_pred, valid.df$Target)
print(conf_matrix)
```
